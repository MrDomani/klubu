 * The whole Reporting area in KluBu will probably need a lot of reworking done also architecturally because I'm not
 * yet sure what the best way to do this would be. Also, I'm not sure whether we would need to generate Reports as PDF/A
 * and store them according to GoBD, but I don't think we would have to. This should allow us to have something that
 * looks nice in a website and also looks nice in a document if you actually want one. This is why for now the only
 * reporting capability that will exist will be a kind of "Live EEUR" within a selectable time frame which should be
 * enough for an MVP.
